# MCP Tools Usage From LangChain / Example in Python [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/hideya/langchain-mcp-tools-py-usage/blob/main/LICENSE)

This simple [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)
client demonstrates the use of MCP server tools by LangChain ReAct Agent.

It leverages a utility function `convert_mcp_to_langchain_tools()` from
[`langchain_mcp_tools`](https://pypi.org/project/langchain-mcp-tools/).  
This function handles parallel initialization of specified multiple MCP servers
and converts their available tools into a list of LangChain-compatible tools
([list[BaseTool]](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/tools/langchain_core.tools.base.BaseTool.html#langchain_core.tools.base.BaseTool)).

Google GenAI's `gemini-2.5-flash` is used as the LLM.
For convenience, code for OpenAI's and Anthropic's LLMs are also included and commented out.

A bit more realistic (conversational) MCP Client is available

A typescript equivalent of this MCP client is available

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- [optional] [`uv` (`uvx`)](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
  installed to run Python package-based MCP servers
- [optional] [npm 7+ (`npx`)](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
  to run Node.js package-based MCP servers
- LLM API keys from
  [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys),
  [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys),
  and/or
  [Google GenAI](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
  as needed

## Usage

1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    make install
    ```

2. Setup API key:
    ```bash
    cp .env.template .env
    ```
    - Update `.env` as needed.
    - `.gitignore` is configured to ignore `.env`
      to prevent accidental commits of the credentials.

3. Run the app:
    ```bash
    make start
    ```
    It takes a while on the first run.

## Simple Exapmle Code for Streamable HTTP Authentiocation

A simple example of showing how to implement an OAuth client provider and
use it with the `langchain-mcp-tools` library can be found
in [`src/streamable_http_oauth_test_client.py`](src/streamable_http_oauth_test_client.py).  

For testing purposes, a sample MCP server with OAuth authentication support
that works with the above client is provided
in [`src/streamable_http_oauth_test_server.py`](src/streamable_http_oauth_test_server.py).  

You can run the server with `make run-streamable-http-oauth-test-server`
and the client with make `run-streamable-http-oauth-test-client`.
